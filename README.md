# petzku's Aegisub scripts

Automation scripts for Aegisub. These are probably mostly useful for typesetters, if anyone.

## Required modules

### DependencyControl

Scripts I make will use [DependencyControl](https://github.com/TypesettingTools/DependencyControl) for versioning and dependency management.

## Scripts

### ClipSize

Tells you the distances between points in a vector clip on the selected line. The utility of this is debatable, but I find it useful to quickly compare sizes of similar signs or text in different parts of the video.
